Have your eyes set on the perfect C library for your project? Can't find a
wrapper for it in Nim? Look no further! Futhark aims to allow you to simply
import C header files directly into Nim, and allow you to use them like you
would from C without any manual intervention. It's still in an alpha state, but
it can already wrap many complex header files without any rewrites or
pre-processing.

```nim
import futhark

# Tell futhark where to find the C libraries you will compile with, and what
# header files you wish to import.
importc:
  sysPath "/usr/lib/clang/12.0.1/include"
  path "../stb"
  define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
  "stb_image.h"

# Tell Nim how to compile against the library. If you have a dynamic library
# this would simply be a `--passL:"-l<library name>`
static:
  writeFile("test.c", """
  #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
  #include "../stb/stb_image.h"
  """)
{.compile: "test.c".}

# Use the library just like you would in C!
var width, height, channels: cint

var image = stbi_load("futhark.png", width.addr, height.addr, channels.addr, STBI_default.cint)
if image == nil:
  echo "Error in loading the image"
  quit 1

echo "Loaded image with a width of ", width, ", a height of ", height, " and ", channels, " channels"
stbi_image_free(image)
```

# So are all C wrappers now obsolete?
Not quite. Futhark only tells you what the C headers define and allows you to
use them. This means that the interface is still very C-like. A lot of great
Nim wrappers will take a C library and wrap it into something that is a little
more simple to use from Nim land. But Futhark can definitely be used to help
with wrapping C libraries. Since it reads the C files directly you are
guaranteed that all the types match up with their C counterparts, no matter
what platform you're on, or what defines you want to pass. This is a huge
benefit over hand-wrapped code. Futhark and Øpir will also cache their results,
so after the initial compilation it's just as fast to use as it simply grabs
the pre-generated Nim file from the cache. Both files could of course also be
edited or included as-is in a project if you want users to not have to run Øpir
or Futhark themselves.

# How does it work?
Basically Futhark comprises of two parts, a helper program called Øpir (or
`opir` just to ensure that it works everywhere) and a module called `futhark`
that exposes a `importc` macro. Øpir is compiled with libclang and uses Clang
to parse and understand the C files, it then creates a big JSON output of
everything that is defined in the headers with Nim friendly types. The macro
then reads this file and applies any overrides to types and names before it
generates all the Nim definitions.

## Basic usage
The three main things you need to know to use Futhark is `sysPath`, `path`, and
normal imports (the `"stb_image.h"` part in the above example).
- `sysPath` denotes system paths, these will be passed to Øpir to make sure
  Clang knows where to find all the definitions.
- `path` denotes library paths, these will also be passed to Øpir, but anything
  found in these paths which is used by the files you have in your project will
  be wrapped by Futhark.
- Files listed in quotes in the importc are equivalent to `#include "file.h"`
  in C. Futhark will generate all definitions in these files, and if `file.h`
  imports more files found in any of the paths passed in by `path` these files
  will also be imported.

Note: The difference between `sysPath` and `path` is simply about how Futhark
handles the file. `sysPath` are paths which are fed to Øpir and Clang in order
to make Clang able to read all the types. `path` are the paths Futhark takes
into account when generating definitions. This difference exists to make sure
Futhark doesn't import all kinds of low-level system stuff which is already
available in Nim. A subpath of `sysPath` can be passed in with `path` without
trouble. So `sysPath "/usr/include"` followed by `path "/usr/include/X11"` is
fine and Futhark will only generate code for the explicitly mentioned files,
and any files it requires from `/usr/include/X11`.

## Hard names and overrides
Nim, unlike C, is case and underscore insensitive and doesn't allow you to have
identifiers starting with `_` or `__`, or identifiers that have more than one
consecutive `_` in them. Nim also has a set of reserved keywords like `proc`,
`addr`, and `type` which would be inconvenient to have as names. Because of
this Futhark will rename these according to some fairly simple rules.

| Name issue       | Nim rename                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| struct type      | `struct_` prefix                                    |
| union type       | `union_` prefix                                     |
| `_` prefix       | `internal` prefix                                   |
| `__` prefix      | `compiler` prefix                                   |
| `__` in name     | All underscores removed                             |
| Reserved keyword | Append kind to name, `proc`, `const`, `struct` etc. |

Since this, along with Nims style-insensitivity means that some identifiers
might collide the name will then further have the kind appended, and if it still
collides it will append the hash of the original identifier. This shouldn't
happen often in real projects and exists mostly to create a foolproof renaming
scheme. Note that struct and union types also get a prefix, this is normally
resolved automatically by C typedef-ing the `struct struct_name` to
`struct_name_t`, but in case you need to use a `struct struct_name` type just
keep in mind that in Nim it will be `struct_struct_name`.

If you want to rename an object or a field you can use the `rename` directive.
Simply put `rename <from>, <to>` along with your other options. `<from>` can be
either just an object name (before any other renaming) as a string or ident, or
a field in the format `<object>.<field>` both the original C names either as
two identifiers, or the whole thing as a single string. `<to>` is always a
single identifier and is the new name.

If you want to implement more complex renaming you can use the `renameCallback`
directive and pass in a callback function that takes the original name, a
string denoting what kind of identifier this is, and an optional string
denoting which object or procedure this identifier occurs in, and which returns
a new string. This callback will be inserted into the renaming logic and will
be called on the original C identifier before all the other rules are applied.

## Redefining types
C tends to use a lot of void pointers, pointers to characters, and pointers to
a single element which is supposed to be a collection of said element. In Nim
we like to be a bit more strict about our types. For this you can use the
`retype` directive. It takes the form `retype <object>.<field>, <Nim type>` so
for example to retype the C array type defined as `some_element* some_field` to
an indexable type in Nim you can use
`retype some_object.some_field, ptr UncheckedArray[some_element]`. The names
for the object and field are both their renamed Nim identifiers. If you need to
redefine an entire object, instead of just specific fields Futhark also gates
every type and procedure definiton in simple `when declared(SomeType)`
statements so that if you want to override a definition you can simply define
your type before the `importc` macro invocation and Futhark won't override your
definition. It is up to you however to ensure that this type actually
matches in size and layout with the original C type.

If a type is not defined in your C headers but is still required for your
project Futhark will generate a `type SomeType = distinct object` dummy type
for it. Since most C libraries will pass things by pointer this makes sure that
a `ptr SomeType` can exist and be passed around without having to know anything
about `SomeType`.

## Destructors
If you are using a C library you will probably want to wrap destructor calls.
Futhark makes all C objects `{.pure, inheritable.}` which means you can quite easily use somewhat idiomatic Nim to achieve destructors.
An example usecase from MiniAudio bindings is as follows:
```nim
type TAudioEngine = object of maEngine # Creates a new object in this scope, which allows destructors

proc `=destroy`(engine: var TAudioEngine) = # Define a destructor as normal
  maEngineUninit(engine.addr)
```

# But why not use c2nim or nimterop?
Both c2nim and nimterop have failed me in the past when wrapping headers. This
boils down to how they are built. c2nim tries to read and understand C files
on its own, something which might appear simple, but C is notoriously hard to
parse and c2nim fails on macros and other slightly complex things. nimterop
uses treesitter and performs slightly better. It is theoretically able to parse
all C syntax, but the C semantics is still up to nimterop to implement. Which
means it can't do macros or things like IFDEF automatically.

Futhark on the other hand uses clang, which is very good at both understand C
syntax, but also C semantics. This means that it resolves all macros and IFDEF
statements, and just gives us the definitions for everything. This means much
less work in actually trying to understand C, which means that all this work
can be spent on quality Nim translation.

# Sounds great, what's the catch?
Futhark is currently in an alpha state. It currently doesn't support C++, and
it doesn't understand things like function-style macros. It might also mess up
on definition types I haven't seen yet in the small handful of libraries I've
tested it against. All of these things are things I hope to get fixed up.

# Installation
To install Futhark you first need to have clang installed. Installing clang on
Linux is as simple as just grabbing it from your package manager (e.g. `sudo
apt install libclang-dev`). To install clang on Windows you need to install
[LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-13.0.1) (you
probably want to grab the `LLVM-13.0.1-win64.exe` version).

If you have Clang installed in your system path you can now simply run:
```
nimble install futhark
```

Otherwise you need to tell Opir how to link with libclang. Do this by either
copying the `libclang.lib` and `libclang.dll` into the Futhark project dir or
use `passL` to pass the folder that `libclang.lib` (or libclang.so on Linux
machines) lives in to the linker:

```
nimble install --passL:"-L<path to lib directory containing libclang.so file>" futhark
#e.g.: nimble install --passL:"-L/usr/lib/llvm-6.0/lib" futhark
```

If you have OSX build instructions please open an issue and explain the process,
even if it is the same as for Linux, just in order to add it as a note.

## TODO
- Proper handling of C macros (inherently hard because C macros are typeless)
- Find way to not require C compiler include paths
- Verify if/make it work on Windows and Mac
